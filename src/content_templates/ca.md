# Canada Self-Employed Tax Guide 2025 (Ontario Focus)

## Maximize Take-Home Pay with Federal and Provincial Planning
Freelancing in Canada, particularly in Ontario, involves balancing two sets of tax brackets. With the 2025 adjustments, precision in your earnings report is more important than ever.

### Tax-Efficient Freelancing in Canada
- **CPP Contributions**: As both employer and employee, you must account for the full 11.9% CPP contribution up to the maximum pensionable earnings.
- **Ontario Provincial Surtax**: High-earners need to be aware of how provincial rates layer onto federal obligations.
- **HST/GST Remittance**: If you earn over $30,000, ensure you are registered and remitting correctly to avoid audit risks.
